Answer the following questions below:

- What tech stack will you use for your final project?
For my final project I will use Node and React

- Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your project? Or are
you going to make an evenly focused full-stack application?
I will use the Nutritionix API for my app. So the focus will be on the UI but I have to understand first how the nutritionix API works

- Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?
It will be a website

- What goal will your project be designed to achieve?
The goal is to implement some features using the nutritionix API

- What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is the demographic of
your users?
Any user who is interested in nutrition. Restaurants owners, and so on

- What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on collecting your data?
You may have not picked your actual API yet, which is fine, just outline what kind
of data you would like it to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data. If you are using a Python/Flask stack are required to create
your own API.
